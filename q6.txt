What is the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts?
flexbox:
- either row or column (one dimension)
- flex can extend to another row when flex items fill the row, flexbox lines things up in one direction
- can not overlap items
- ideal for laying out items in ways that they can dynamically resize
CSS grid:
- row and column (two dimensions)
- can overlap items
- provides more alignment which is why it's ideal for overall page layout
