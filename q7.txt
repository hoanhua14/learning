Explain the concepts of and differences between props and state in React.
props: passing data, value, or even a function down from parent to child in single direction, either we state props in the parents or not, it's still being passed down, but if we give it the name 'props' (or other names for better readability) , we can easily work on the passed down properties.
state: is used to manage and store data within a component. We use useState which always return 2 values: the current state and a set function to update that state. We access these data using array destructuring when initiating the state ( const [age, setAge] = useState(''); in this example we can render age onto the page as user types in or manipulate that data using setAge which makes state mutable) . One important aspect of state is that it triggers rerendering of the component itself.
