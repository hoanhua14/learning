What is typecasting and when should you use it?
Typecasting is a feature in TypeScript to convert a value from one data type to another, allowing automatic implicit conversion by the language itself or explicitly by the developer's intention.
Some typecasting might not work on React files such as let x: unknown = 'hello';
console.log((<string>x).length);
Use cases:
- Input/Output formatting, making sure data getting saved int the database is the right type/ format.
- Changing data type for comparison, or to apply type-specific methods on the value.
